# Crypto_Algorithmic_Trading
This repository contains code for algorithmically trading cryptocurrencies.

<strong>Introduction:</strong>

We will create a cryptocurrency wallet app with the ability to perform algorithmic trading. Specifically, our app will look for arbitrage opportunities.

The app will repeatedly query the various exchanges rates between cryptocurrencies. If it finds a situation where the exchange rates are not consistent, then it automatic executes a trade. In other words, create a bot which finds arbitrage opportunities between different crypto-currencies.

For example, the app will check the USD exchange rate for Bitcoin at exchange A and the exchange rate for Bitcoin at exchange B. If the associated fees are less than the difference in price, then the app will automatically execute a trade.
